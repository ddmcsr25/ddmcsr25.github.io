  <h1>Android Lock Screen & FRP Bypass Vulnerability on Pixel 6 (Android 14)</h1>

  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Derek Morris &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Reported to Google:</strong> June 2024 &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Status:</strong> Rewarded – Marked as Won’t Fix (Intended Behavior)</p>

  <p>This public disclosure details a working method to bypass both the Android 14 lock screen and Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on a locked Google Pixel 6. This exploit uses publicly available tools and an official OTA update to unlock the device without knowing the PIN or linked Google account. The device remains fully locked (bootloader, USB debugging off, FRP active), yet the attacker gains full access after a sideloaded update process.</p>

  <p>Unlike most theoretical bypasses, this technique was tested on a fully updated Pixel 6 with June 2024 security patches. The vulnerability was reported to Google through the Android Security Rewards program, rewarded financially, but ultimately marked as intended behavior and not patched.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>This vulnerability allows attackers to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bypass Android lock screen and Google account verification</li>
    <li>Remove Factory Reset Protection without authentication</li>
    <li>Unlock a secured Pixel 6 without PIN, pattern, or password</li>
    <li>Enable developer mode, OEM unlock, and flash new ROMs</li>
    <li>Resell or repurpose locked Android devices without traceability</li>
  </ul>

    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reproduction Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Tested on Pixel 6 (Android 14, June 2024 security patch). Required tools:
      <ul>
        <li>Android Platform Tools (ADB)</li>
        <li>Pixel Flasher Tool</li>
        <li>Android 15 Beta 3.1 OTA image</li>
      </ul>
      Full steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Boot into recovery and factory reset the device.</li>
        <li>Complete setup with a Google account and PIN; confirm FRP is active.</li>
        <li>Reboot into recovery mode → Select “Apply update from ADB.”</li>
        <li>Connect to PC via USB → Use Pixel Flasher to sideload Android 15 beta image.</li>
        <li>Once flashed, reboot the device → Setup no longer enforces previous account or lock.</li>
        <li>Developer options and OEM unlocking now accessible.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Root Cause</h2>
    <p>
      Android’s ADB sideload implementation does not properly enforce FRP state post-flash. The process resets the security state without re-verifying the account or PIN lock after flashing an OTA image.

    <h2>Google's Response</h2>
